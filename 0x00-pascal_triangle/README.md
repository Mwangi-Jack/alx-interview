# Pascal's Triangle
- This is an arrangement of binomial coefficients in a triangular form
- The numbers in a pascal's triangle are placed in such a way that each number is the sum of two numbers just above the number


## Pascal's Triangle Formula
The formula to fill the number in the nth column and mth row of Pascal's triangle we use the Pascals triangle formula. The formula requires the knowledge of the elements in the (n-1)th row, and (m-1)th and nth columns. The elements of the nth row of Pascal's triangle are given by, nC0, nC1, nC2, ..., nCn. The formula for Pascal's triangle is:

<sup>n</sup>C<sub>m</sub> = <sup>n - 1</sup>C<sub>m - 1</sub> + <sup>n - 1</sup>C<sub>m</sub>


where

<sup>n</sup>C<sub>m</sub> represents the (m+1)th element in the nth row.
n is a non-negative integer, and
0 ≤ m ≤ n.
